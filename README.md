# Neural Network with Backpropagation

## Overview
This project, written and submitted for an Artificial Intelligence university module assessment, implements a backpropagation algorithm for a neural network written in Python.

This demonstrates the following machine learning concepts:
	- Forward propagation
	- Sigmoid activation function
	- Backpropagation

The network consists of:
	- 3 input nodes
	- 1 hidden layer, with 3 nodes
	- 2 output nodes

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository, found at https://github.com/aishasaghir/neuralnetworkpropagation/.
2. Open the .py file using Python IDLE version 3.10.4.
3. Press F5, or navigate to the "Run" tab on the top toolbar and click "Run Module".

Training progress and weight values are printed to the console. 
After training, the neural network is tested with a sample input.

Please note: The application will run if opened via the file explorer, however will terminate upon testing completion.
